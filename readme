Ion Bombardment 

A repository containing LAMMPS scripts, some of which are run using Python. The scripts are for ion bombardment simulations to study crater formation in the vacuum arcing process. 

To run the simulations, LAMMPS, Python, and the Python LAMMPS module are required. 

Python modules used:
numpy, mpi4py, lammps, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, pyperclip

LAMMPS packages used:
MANYBODY, python

pythonscripts:
    Contains python scripts used in the project divided among three subdirectories: helpers, lammps_functions, and sim_runners.

    helpers:
        Contains helper-programs for analysing the output, generating input data, testing etc.
    
    lammps_functions:
        Contains python functions, which a LAMMPS simulation can call using fix python or other such command. These files are designed to be called from LAMMPS
        rather than running LAMMPS.

    sim_runners:
        Contains python-scripts that run LAMMPS from python using the LAMMPS module. 

lammps:
    Contains files necessary to run LAMMPS simulations, such as input scripts, and interatomic potentials. These files are divided among four subdirectories: helpers, input_scripts, legacy, and relaxation_scripts.

    helpers:
        Contains helper-scripts for analysing the output

    input_scripts:
        Contains LAMMPS input scripts used in the project.

    legacy:
        Contains scripts that are no longer needed, but may be useful to look at.
    
    relaxation_scripts:
        Contains LAMMPS input scripts to relax the metal surface.

energy_dist:
    Contains the figure of the energy distribution from ArcPIC, digitized csv data of the distribution curve, and a python script sampling the distribution.


As of 30.01.25 most paths to different files are incorrect, as the architecture was changed significantly.
